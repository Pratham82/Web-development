        <h2>It mainly consist of the basic HTML structure</h2>
        <p class="main">
            First developed by Tim <strong>Berners-Lee</strong> in 1990, <em>HTML</em> is short for Hypertext Markup
            Language.
            <br> HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web.
            Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks.
            Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another.

            HTML code ensures the proper <b>formatting</b> of text and images for your Internet browser.
            Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements.
            HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change
            its appearance.
            One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).
